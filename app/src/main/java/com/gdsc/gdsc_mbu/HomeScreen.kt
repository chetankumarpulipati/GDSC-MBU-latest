                The Python Programming course, a collaborative effort between GDSC MBU and OrcadeHub, spanned 10 days of immersive learning. It began with an introduction to Python's history, features, and setup, followed by basic syntax, data types, and operators. The course progressed to cover conditional statements and loops, providing participants with a solid foundation in control structures.

                Day 4 focused on functions and modules, including defining functions, understanding scope, and using standard library modules. Day 5 and 6 delved into data structures, with comprehensive sessions on lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, supplemented by practical programs and mini-projects.

                Participants then explored object-oriented programming, mastering classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Exception handling techniques were covered on Day 8, emphasizing practical examples and custom exceptions.

                Days 9 and 10 introduced important libraries and frameworks, including NumPy, Pandas, Flask, and multi-threading/multi-processing concepts. The course culminated in a final project where participants applied their knowledge to develop a small project, demonstrating their skills across various Python topics.

                This collaborative event provided a structured and practical approach to Python programming, empowering attendees with the confidence and competence to tackle real-world coding challenges.

                The Python Programming course, a collaborative effort between GDSC MBU and OrcadeHub, spanned 10 days of immersive learning. It began with an introduction to Python's history, features, and setup, followed by basic syntax, data types, and operators. The course progressed to cover conditional statements and loops, providing participants with a solid foundation in control structures.

                Day 4 focused on functions and modules, including defining functions, understanding scope, and using standard library modules. Day 5 and 6 delved into data structures, with comprehensive sessions on lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, supplemented by practical programs and mini-projects.

                Participants then explored object-oriented programming, mastering classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Exception handling techniques were covered on Day 8, emphasizing practical examples and custom exceptions.

                Days 9 and 10 introduced important libraries and frameworks, including NumPy, Pandas, Flask, and multi-threading/multi-processing concepts. The course culminated in a final project where participants applied their knowledge to develop a small project, demonstrating their skills across various Python topics.

                This collaborative event provided a structured and practical approach to Python programming, empowering attendees with the confidence and competence to tackle real-world coding challenges.

                Why should I enrol in the program?
                There are a lot of things in store for you. We want to make sure that by the end of this program:

                1. You can showcase what you've learned here to your professional network using Google Cloud-hosted digital badges (see below) that you can add to your resume and professional profiles like LinkedIn. üèÜ

                2. And on top of these amazing badges, get a chance to earn Arcade + Bonus Points and redeem them for some really cool Google Cloud goodies*. üí™ (See Points System section)


                Points System
                For the badges and milestones that you complete in the Facilitator program, you will earn several "Arcade  + Bonus Points" that you can REDEEM for prizes and Google Cloud goodies at the Arcade prize counter. 

                See what's the criteria of earning these points below. You can also checkout the official Google Cloud Arcade website here for more details on the points system.

                Here's what you need to know about the points system:
                For each "Game" badge you complete, you will be awarded with 1 Arcade point. Eg: If you complete 2 game badges, you will receive 2 points & so on.

                For each "Trivia" badge you complete, you will be awarded with 1 Arcade Point. Eg: If you complete 2 trivia badges, you will receive 2 points.

                For every 2 "Skill Badge" completions, you will be awarded with 1 Arcade Point. Eg: If you complete 4 skill badges, you will receive 2 points & so on.

                On completion of any of the milestones mentioned below, you will receive the mentioned Bonus Arcade Points. (Note: You will only receive points for the milestone that you earn and not for the ones before that.)

                Syllabus for the program
                While you can find all the active games and trivia quests on the Google Cloud Arcade website directly, we are maintaining a copy of the same here so that it becomes easier for you to find badges and complete them so that you can earn "Arcade Points". (See points system for more details)

                Recommended - Its better to complete the games and trivia first since they have a deadline in a given month. Complete as many skill badges as you can later to earn more "Arcade Points".

                **Important Note:** - The Arcade and Trivia Games are going to start in August. Hence, its recommended that you complete as many skill badges as possible in July and wait for games to be released in August.

                Arcade Games
                Every month we release 4 new Arcade games that you can complete to earn "Arcade Points". Hence, in a single cohort of 2 months under the Facilitator Program, you can earn a total of 8 game badges. See the currently active games for this month below. We will update these as and when new games will be released in the following months. Note: Games have limited seats, so enrol and complete them ASAP.

                Note: While there are a total of 4 games that are released every month and you can complete 8 games in total in the 2 months of the facilitator program, any 6 game completions will be counted towards the ultimate milestone.



                Arcade Trivia Games
                Every month we release 4 new Trivia Games on a weekly basis, that you can complete to earn "Arcade Points". Hence, in a single cohort of 2 months under the Facilitator Program, you can earn a total of 8 Trivia Game Badges. See the currently active Trivia Games for this month below. We will update this as and when new Trivia games are released every week.

                Note: Trivia games are released on a weekly basis i.e. in Week 1, you will have 1 Trivia Game, in Week 2, you will have 2 Trivia Games, in Week 3, you will have 3 Trivia Games and thus all 4 Trivia Games will only we available in the last week of every month.



                Google Cloud Skill Badges
                You can complete any of the skill badges that are part of our catalog here to earn "Arcade Points". To help you easily navigate this list, we have added a few skill badges for you below that you can choose from based on what level of difficulty you are looking for.

                We will keep updating this list with new skill badges for you to explore.
